# Video-Based Human Action Recognition

– This project implements human action recognition on videos using a
Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Long-Short Term
Memory Network.

– ConvLSTM and LRCN approaches are implemented and compared for
this problem.

– UCF50 Action Recognition Dataset is used.

– Evaluation of models on test data
ConvLSTM:
1) accuracy: 0.7377
2) loss: 0.7642
LRCN:
1) accuracy: 0.8197
2) loss: 0.4610

– Technologies used: Numpy, Python, Tensorflow.
