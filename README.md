# Video-Based Human Action Recognition

– This project implements human action recognition on videos using a
Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Long-Short Term
Memory Network.

– ConvLSTM and LRCN approaches are implemented and compared for
this problem.
– Technologies used: Numpy, Python, Tensorflow.
